Notes
class="sc-1thi3bz-0 iQlMNh" is the annoying bar at the bottom of the game window

TODO

--Data Collection--
 - We need a way to collect and format the pixels of the game to the alg. 
Likely screenshots, but what is the best way to do this consistently?
How will the data be handled, both processing and deleting.

--Reward Modeling--
 - The reward for the algorithm will be the score. We need a 100% accurate way to determine the score from the game. 
 The score of the game is recorded in the top left corner of the game window, so we can get that information from screenshots
    - The best way is to have hardcoded images of the score font, then parse the top left to determine the total score

--Model Architecture-- 
 - I honestly need to do some serious review in this category. I think we could do a minimax and train the evaluation function on the screenshots
 - We could also do a Deep RL approach, but I don't know enough about how that works to implement it just yet

--Training--
If we are going for the minimax approach, how are we going to get labelled data for the situation and right move to play, other than recording a human play?
    If we are going to do this approach, we need to also have a data collection script written.
If we go for the Deep RL approach, how are we going to spin up many instance of the game to train on?

--Other--
I can see a possible latency issue with the algorithm, that being a lag between the pixels being displayed in the browser,
the algorithm calculating a move, and then sending the move back to the browser.
How do we resolve this?

Test speed of screenshot method
